# Stellarium Custom Landscapes

Contains instructions and custom landscapes used with Stellarium

We use 2048x1024 image of a 360 degree panaramas for the landscape.

## Instructions

### Create a Panorama

1. Place the camera on a tripod. Set the height of the tripod at the heiieght of the telelscopes average eyepiece height.
2. Transfer this height to a point that will mark the start of the panorama. This will mark the true horizon in the panorama.
3. Take a single panaorama image with the true horizon in the image. You want it to note the half height of the spherical image. Dont wory about gettint the straight up in the image. You will intepolate the hole at the top as the appropriate sky.

### Acquire Obsertitory Coordinates

1. Use a GPS to acquire the observatory coordinates.
2. Use a compass to acquire the magnetic declination to the marker for the true horizon. This is used to set the rotation of the panorama.

### Pepare the Panorama

1. Use a photo editor to crop the image to remove the final redundancyon the left and right of the panorama. You want th horizon mark on the left side of the image to help when aligning the image.
